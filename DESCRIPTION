Description: Three high-dimensional outlier detection algorithms and a outlier unification scheme are implemented in this package. The angle-based outlier detection (ABOD) algorithm is based on the work of Kriegel, Schubert, and Zimek [2008]. The subspace outlier detection (SOD) algorithm is based on the work of Kriegel, Kroger, Schubert, and Zimek [2009]. The feature bagging-based outlier detection (FBOD) algorithm is based on the work of Lazarevic and Kumar [2005]. The outlier unification scheme is based on the work of Kriegel, Kroger, Schubert, and Zimek [2011].
